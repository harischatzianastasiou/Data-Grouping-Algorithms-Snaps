USE OF DATA GROUPING ALGORITHMS FOR ANOMALY DETECTION IN IOT SYSTEMS

· Implementation of Denstream clustering algorithm in an IoT device, to propose a low-cost approach to detect anomaly behavior in IoT.

· Recreation of the IoT enviroment with Ubuntu Core (snaps) on a Raspberry Pi. 
· Development of Denstream python snap application.
· Development of a monitoring python snap application to capture device resource usage. 
· Development of weather python snap application to define normal behavior of the device.
· Development of malicious python snap applications to define abnormal behaviors of the device. 
· Execution of the monitoring snap application while the device operates under normal and abnormal behavior respectively. 
· Creation of different datasets that describe normal and abnormal behavior. 
· Examination of Denstream's effectiveness to detect the abnormal behavior, compared to other clustering algorithms.
